      "want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
      "free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
      "these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",

      "you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",

      "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
